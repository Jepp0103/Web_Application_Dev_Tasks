                    William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet, and
                    actor,
                    widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.
                    He is
                    often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant
                    works,
                    including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few
                    other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living
                    language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. They also continue to be
                    studied and reinterpreted.

                    Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married
                    Anne
                    Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between
                    1585
                    and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing
                    company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613),
                    he
                    appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's
                    private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his
                    physical
                    appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
                    written
                    by others.

                    Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily
                    comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then
                    wrote
                    mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth,
                    all
                    considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he
                    wrote
                    tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.

                    Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his
                    lifetime.
                    However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                    published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of
                    Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a
                    poem
                    by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hailed Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an
                    age,
                    but for all time".

                    To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
                    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
                    To the last syllable of recorded time,
                    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
                    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
                    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
                    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
                    And then is heard no more: it is a tale
                    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
                    Signifying nothing.

                    (Macbeth, act 5 scene 5)
